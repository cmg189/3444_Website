### Objective

In Food Fight, the objective is to eat your opponentâ€™s food before they eat yours!

### Instructions

1. Start by:

	Positioning your food items (hotdogs, hamburgers, ice cream, etc.) on your side of the game area. This is done by pressing the *Reposition Food Items* button.

	Note: These locations are hidden from the opponent.

	The opponent (i.e. computer) will also position their food items on their side of the game area.


2. Once you are satisfied with the locations of your food items press the *Ready* button to begin the game!


3. Game play

	You will notice your gameboard has shifted to the right hand side of the screen.

	In the center of the screen will be your opponent's gameboard with their food items hidden.

	Hovering your mouse over the opponent's gameboard will turn your cursor into the image of a fork! This indicates that it is your turn to choose a location on the gameboard in an attempt to find and eat their food items. Choosing a location is a simple as left clicking on a cell of the gameboard!

	Once you have chosen a location on the opponent's gameboard:

	An image of a circle will appear if you have eaten a part of the opponent's food item.

	An image of an X will appear if you have chosen a position in the gameboard that does not contain a food item.

	Now that you have chosen a position, it is the opponent's turn to try and eat your food!

	This process will continue until either you or the opponent has eaten all the food items on the gameboard.

4. End game

 	If you have won the game a congratulatory message will appear indicating that you won.

	Similarly, a message will appear indicating you have lost if that is the case.
