## Food Fight
Food Fight is a single-player game that is based on the popular Battleship board game.

In Food Fight, the goal is to eat (locate) your opponent’s food before they eat yours!

You will start by positioning your food items (hotdogs, hamburgers, ice cream, etc.) on your side of the game area.
These locations are hidden from the opponent.

The opponent will also position their food items on their side of the game area.
(The game area is a 15x15 grid)

Once you position all the food items, you will take turns with the opponent to select different locations on the game area.

By selecting different locations, you are activly trying to eat (locate) all of the opponent's food items.

Food items consist of varying sizes (columns x rows), for example:

Hotdog: 1x4

Hamburger: 2x2

Ice cream: 3x3

The first player to eat all of the other player’s food items wins the game!
